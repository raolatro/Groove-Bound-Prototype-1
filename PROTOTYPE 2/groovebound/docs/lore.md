# Groove Bound - LORE SUMMARISED

Joe, a burned-out office worker, stumbles upon the mysterious Wizard of Groove busking on the street after a draining day. Chosen to restore rhythm to the universe, Joe is thrust into a cosmic quest across genre-themed planets, each ruled by a legendary musician like Bob Marley, Snoop Dogg, Michael Jackson, and Jimi Hendrix. Battling bizarre rhythmless creatures and unlocking powerful musical artifacts, Joe gradually evolves from a rhythmless everyman into a true musician. His mission isn’t fame, but to reignite the universal groove and rediscover the joy that music brings to life.


# Groove Bound - FULL LORE

Joe is exhausted. Trapped in the relentless monotony of his grey cubicle, he's losing his spark. Music—once his passion and escape—has faded into a distant memory, buried beneath endless spreadsheets and deadlines. One particularly soul-draining evening, as he trudges home through the rain-soaked streets, Joe encounters a strange figure busking beneath flickering streetlights: the eccentric and enigmatic Wizard of Groove.

The Wizard, a charismatic guardian of rhythm from an alternate dimension, informs Joe that he's been chosen—not because he's already a musician, but precisely because he desperately needs rhythm back in his life. Joe is bound to the mystical Rhythm Core, a powerful source at the heart of all music across universes. Without it, creativity, joy, and rhythm itself will fade into oblivion.

To restore balance, Joe must traverse diverse planets, each representing distinct musical genres. From the fiery landscape of Rockalon to the neon-lit metropolis of Synthoria, each planet is now under siege by creatures born of apathy and monotony, manifestations of all things rhythmless and dull. These adversaries range from sluggish Tempo Leeches, droning Monotones, robotic Clicktrack Clones, and zombie-like Boredom Shufflers, each draining energy and color from their musical worlds.

At the climax of each planet, Joe confronts legendary musicians deeply emblematic of their respective musical genres. He'll face iconic battles against legends such as Bob Marley on Reggae Realm, Snoop Dogg in Hip-Hop Haven, Michael Jackson in Pop Paradise, and Jimi Hendrix on Rockalon, each guarding the rhythm of their worlds.

Defeating each legend doesn't bring Joe personal fame or headline performances; rather, it grants him unique legendary instruments or artifacts intrinsically tied to the essence of each musical realm. These rewards include the Eternal Stratocaster from Rockalon, resonating with endless sustain and power; the Infinity Synth from Synthoria, capable of weaving infinite layers of sound; the Celestial Sax from Jazztopia, echoing boundless improvisational possibilities; and the Pulse Orb Bass from Basslandia, vibrating with unmatched depth and groove.

With each victory, Joe’s own musical prowess grows, transforming him gradually from a hesitant novice into a skilled and versatile musician. As he restores rhythm across the realms, he finds himself revitalized, breaking free from his mundane existence and rediscovering his passion for life.

Ultimately, after all planets have their rhythm reinstated, Joe achieves the greatest milestone of all: mastering the Harmony Catalyst, an artifact born from the fusion of all genres. By activating it, Joe doesn't simply restore rhythm to the realms; he ignites an eternal groove, reconnecting countless souls—including his own—to the universal heartbeat of music.
